# Todd Reborn Backend

## What is Todd?
Todd is an attempt at creating a "better" personal assistant experience than you'd get when using Siri or Google Assistant (or any generic voice based personal assistance for that matter). This is also a personal project of mine where I want to gain experience building out an architecture that I've designed, using tools and tech that I think is really neat. While using LLMs and AI based voice generation for something like this is very niche (and arguably overkill as hell), it's a fun idea that I'm passionate about and would love to eventually have support for others to use Todd as well.
